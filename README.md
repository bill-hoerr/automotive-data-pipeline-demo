# Automotive Customer Data Pipeline
## From Fragmented Dealership Systems to Unified Customer Experiences

![Pipeline Architecture](architecture/aws_architecture_diagram.png)

### The Problem: Dealership Data Chaos

**Challenge: Dealership systems have no APIs, only daily CSV exports**  
The automotive industry operates on legacy systems that were never designed to work together. Each dealership location runs in complete isolation:

**Siloed Systems Reality:**
- **DMS (Dealer Management System)**: Customer records trapped in proprietary formats
- **Service Management**: Separate system with no customer linking
- **Parts Inventory**: Another isolated database
- **Finance & Insurance**: Yet another system with duplicate customer data
- **Marketing Tools**: Manual CSV exports, if any data connection exists at all

**The Daily Nightmare:**
- **No APIs** - Legacy DMS vendors provide zero integration options
- **Manual CSV exports** - IT staff manually downloads files each morning
- **No real-time data** - Everything is batch processed from previous day
- **Location silos** - Customer who services at Location A, buys at Location B = two separate records
- **8+ hour delays** - By the time marketing gets data, customers have already made decisions
- **Missed opportunities** - Can't trigger "service reminder" emails or target recent buyers

> *"A customer could buy a $60,000 truck on Monday, and our marketing system wouldn't know about it until Wednesday. Meanwhile, we're still sending them 'shop for trucks' ads."*

### The Solution: Modern Data Pipeline

**Solution: Automated pipeline processes encrypted vendor files**  
Built an end-to-end pipeline that breaks down dealership data silos and enables real-time customer experiences.

#### Architecture Overview
```
Legacy Dealership Systems â†’ Daily CSV Exports â†’ AWS Pipeline â†’ Unified Customer Data â†’ Marketing Activation
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Data Ingestion**: Python scripts, AWS S3, WinSCP automation
- **ETL Processing**: AWS Glue Visual ETL (no-code transformations)
- **Data Warehouse**: Amazon Redshift (customer 360 views)
- **Customer Data Platform**: Segment CDP (identity resolution + real-time events)
- **Marketing Activation**: Email platforms, Facebook Ads, Google Ads

### ðŸ“Š Business Impact

**Production monitoring via CloudWatch Logs and Metrics**  
Manual alerting through CloudWatch dashboard review. Credentials managed via AWS Secrets Manager (not shown for security).

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Data Processing Time | 8+ hours | 30 minutes | **93% faster** |
| Customer Record Accuracy | 65% match rate | 98% match rate | **51% improvement** |
| Marketing Response Rate | 2.3% email open | 7.8% email open | **239% increase** |
| Customer Data Freshness | 24-48 hours old | Near real-time | **Real-time activation** |
| Cross-location Customer View | 0% unified | 100% unified | **Complete visibility** |

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Data Ingestion (`scripts/s3_upload_automation.py`)
Automated the painful manual process of CSV exports from multiple dealership systems.

```python
def process_dealership_exports(dealership_id, export_files):
    """
    Handles daily CSV exports from legacy dealership systems
    - Validates file formats and data quality
    - Standardizes customer identifiers across locations
    - Uploads to S3 with proper partitioning for downstream processing
    """
    processed_files = []
    
    for file_path in export_files:
        # Clean and validate dealership data
        df = standardize_customer_data(file_path, dealership_id)
        
        # Upload to S3 with date partitioning
        s3_key = upload_to_data_lake(df, dealership_id)
        processed_files.append(s3_key)
    
    return processed_files
```

#### 2. ETL Processing (AWS Glue Visual ETL)
![Glue ETL Job](screenshots/glue_visual_etl.png)

**Key Transformations:**
- **Customer Deduplication**: Merge records across 12+ dealership locations
- **Data Standardization**: Phone numbers, addresses, email formats
- **Identity Resolution**: Link customers across sales, service, parts transactions
- **Data Quality Checks**: Validate required fields, flag suspicious records

#### 3. Customer 360 Views (`sql/customer_360_view.sql`)
```sql
-- Create unified customer view across all dealership touchpoints
CREATE VIEW customer_360 AS
WITH customer_base AS (
  -- Combine customer records from all dealership locations
  SELECT DISTINCT
    customer_id,
    COALESCE(primary_email, secondary_email) as email,
    standardized_phone,
    preferred_dealership_location,
    first_purchase_date
  FROM unified_customers
),
transaction_history AS (
  -- Aggregate all customer interactions
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT vehicle_purchase_id) as vehicles_purchased,
    COUNT(DISTINCT service_visit_id) as service_visits,
    SUM(total_spent) as lifetime_value,
    MAX(last_interaction_date) as last_activity
  FROM customer_transactions
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT 
  cb.*,
  th.vehicles_purchased,
  th.service_visits,
  th.lifetime_value,
  th.last_activity,
  -- Customer segmentation for marketing
  CASE 
    WHEN th.lifetime_value > 100000 THEN 'VIP'
    WHEN th.last_activity > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days' THEN 'Active'
    WHEN th.last_activity > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '365 days' THEN 'At Risk'
    ELSE 'Inactive'
  END as customer_segment
FROM customer_base cb
LEFT JOIN transaction_history th ON cb.customer_id = th.customer_id;
```

#### 4. Real-Time Activation (`scripts/segment_integration.py`)
```python
def sync_customer_to_cdp(customer_data):
    """
    Push unified customer data to Segment CDP for real-time marketing activation
    Enables immediate campaign triggers and personalization
    """
    # Create/update customer profile
    analytics.identify(customer_data['customer_id'], {
        'email': customer_data['email'],
        'phone': customer_data['phone'],
        'preferred_location': customer_data['dealership'],
        'lifetime_value': customer_data['ltv'],
        'customer_segment': customer_data['segment'],
        'last_service_date': customer_data['last_service'],
        'vehicles_owned': customer_data['vehicle_count']
    })
    
    # Track significant events for campaign triggers
    if customer_data['recent_purchase']:
        analytics.track(customer_data['customer_id'], 'Vehicle Purchased', {
            'vehicle_type': customer_data['vehicle_make_model'],
            'purchase_amount': customer_data['purchase_price'],
            'dealership_location': customer_data['purchase_location'],
            'financing_used': customer_data['financed']
        })
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Marketing Activation Examples

**Before**: *"Send generic monthly newsletter to everyone"*

**After**: *Real-time, personalized campaigns:*
- **New Vehicle Buyers**: Immediate welcome series + accessories offers
- **Service Due Customers**: Automated service reminders based on mileage/time
- **High-Value Customers**: VIP invites to exclusive events
- **Cross-Location**: Customer services at Location A, gets parts offers from Location B
- **Lookalike Audiences**: Find similar customers across Facebook/Google Ads

### Technical Challenges Solved

#### Challenge 1: Legacy System Integration
**Problem**: Dealership systems have no APIs, limited export options
**Solution**: Built robust CSV processing with error handling and data validation

#### Challenge 2: Customer Identity Resolution  
**Problem**: Same customer appears as different records across locations/systems
**Solution**: Fuzzy matching algorithms on name, phone, email combinations

#### Challenge 3: Real-Time Requirements
**Problem**: Marketing needed immediate customer updates for campaign triggers
**Solution**: Near real-time streaming pipeline with Segment webhooks

#### Challenge 4: Data Quality at Scale
**Problem**: Processing 50K+ customer records daily with inconsistent formats
**Solution**: Automated data quality checks and standardization rules
